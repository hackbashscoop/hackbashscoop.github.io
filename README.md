# HackBashScoop


Best practices and recipes for solo data exploration and programming, a sort of "hitchhiker's guide" of advice, examples, and use-cases for everyday programming and analysis, as a way to become more proficient and familiar with technical skills, with a bonus of testing investigative leads and hypotheses

Aimed towards folks who have been introduced to coding and data, and/or who've had a formal education in it.

The build for this site should be at:
